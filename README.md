Keylogger

This keylogger task is solely for educational purposes given by Prodigy InfoTech as part of educational internship. I do not endorse or encourage any unauthorized or malicious use of keyloggers. Users are reminded to act responsibly and ethically in their endeavors.

# Project Overview:
The keylogger program is designed to record and log keystrokes on a computer system. It utilizes the `pynput` library in Python to monitor keyboard inputs and saves the keystrokes to a log file.

Key Features:
- Monitors keystrokes in real-time.
- Saves the keystrokes to a log file (`log.txt`).
- Allows for easy termination by pressing the 'Escape' key.

  # Functions used in
- pynput -This allows you to control and monitor input devices.
- open- open() in python is used to open a file in the desired mode the user wants and returns the requested file object
- Listener - The Listener class is an “abstract” base class for any objects which wish to register to receive notifications of new messages A Listener can be used in two ways; the default is to call the Listener with a new message, or by calling the method on_message_received.
